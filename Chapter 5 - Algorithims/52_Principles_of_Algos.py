Principles of Algorithm


* Algorithims are the foundations of all computing
* Theoritical foundation of algorithims, in the form of the Turing machine, was established decades before digital logic circuits
* The Turing machine is essentially a mathmatical mode that turns a predefined sets of inputs into outputs
* First implementations were mechanical, next ones could be digital and finally could be replaced with quantum computing

* Algorithims also have an effect in technological innovation
* Consider the page rank search algo - A variation of Google search engine is based on
* This leads to rapid developments since researches can increase their development rate.



Four reasons to study algos!

1. They are essential for computer science and intelligent systems
2. They are important in many other domains
3. They play a role in tech innovation
4. They improve problem solving and analytical skills


Algos in their simplest form are just a sequence of actions, a list of instructions. It may just
be a lineage construct of the form do x, then do y , then do z.


Algos are composed of the four following elements:

* Sequential operations
* Actions based on the state of a data structure
* Iteration, repeating an action a number of times
* Recursion, calling itself on a subset of inputs
