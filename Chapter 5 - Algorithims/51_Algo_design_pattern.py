Algo Design Paradigms:


Three broad approaches to algo design:

* Divide and Conquer
* Greedy Algos
* Dynamic Programming



Divide and Conquer:
* This involves breaking down a complex problem into a series of smaller problems
* The same as deconstruction
* After breaking down the problem, combining the results into a global solution
* Most common algo design paradigm

Greedy Algos:
* involve optimzation and combination problems;
* basically find the best solution to a local problem in the hope that this will lead to a global solution.


Dynamic Programming:
* useful when sup-problems overlap
* with dynamic proramming, intermediate results are chached and can be used in subsequent operations.
* Like divide and conquer - it uses recursion; however dynamic programming allows us o compare results at different stages
